# AI-Procrastination-Predictor 🧠

An intelligent, behavior-aware system that **predicts procrastination before it happens** and delivers **adaptive intervention messages** to help users avoid long distraction cycles.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project?

Most productivity tools react *after* time is already wasted — showing screen time, usage stats, or generic reminders.

This project takes a **proactive approach**:
- It learns **personal behavior patterns**
- Predicts **high-risk moments of distraction**
- Intervenes **at the right time**, with the right intensity

The goal is not to block users, but to **help them pause, reflect, and act early**.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

Procrastination is not random — it follows patterns.

By analyzing behavioral signals such as:
- Time of day
- Social media usage
- App switching behavior
- Focus vs distraction trends  

the system estimates a **procrastination risk score** and responds with **context-aware interventions**.

---

## ⚙️ What the System Does

- Predicts the likelihood of procrastination in the current moment  
- Identifies low-distraction focus windows  
- Escalates intervention strength if distraction continues  
- Demonstrates how AI can support digital wellbeing proactively  

An interactive **Streamlit app** is used to simulate real-time scenarios and showcase the system’s behavior.

## 📊 Data & Modeling Approach

- Uses **behavior-specific, privacy-aware simulated data**
- Each data point represents **hourly user behavior**
- Machine Learning model:
  - Logistic Regression for interpretable risk prediction
- Focuses on **decision quality and usefulness**, not just accuracy

---

## 🧪 Validation Strategy

The system was evaluated using:
- Train–test split metrics
- Sanity testing with realistic behavioral scenarios

Predictions and intervention responses aligned well with expected human behavior, especially during high-risk periods such as late-night usage.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Students struggling with procrastination and focus  
- Concept can extend to:
  - Working professionals  
  - Freelancers  
  - Digital wellbeing platforms  

This project is designed as a **proof-of-concept**, demonstrating how AI-driven behavioral insights can improve self-regulation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Streamlit  

---

## ⚠️ Scope & Limitations

- Uses simulated behavior data due to privacy constraints  
- Does not monitor content or personal information  
- Does not enforce app blocking — focuses on guidance and awareness  
- Intended as a prototype, not a production mobile system  

---

## 🔮 Future Directions

- Integration with real usage statistics APIs  
- Long-term habit modeling with time-series methods  
- Personalized motivational strategies  
- Mobile-level intervention mechanisms
